# ContÃªiner MongoDB + API Golang

## Activity

Evolve your Golang service to expose a /info API to HTTP GET requests, where the JSON content that gets returned is obtained from a MongoDB entry.

Send me a screenshot of your docker-compose.yml, of your source code and of your Browser network tab showing the request successfully being made.
